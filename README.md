These projects are some basic machine learning Python applications that I have previous work on.

Files in "6.S191" are my writings of the lab assignments from the publicly available 6.S191 course labs.
Lab 1.1 is a basic intro to TensorFlow.
Lab 1.2 is a mostly guided creation of a RNN used to generate music.

Files in "Independent" are re-tooled code from various tutorials and past projects.
ML_Beginning.py is a very basic manually coded NN.
TensorFlowTut.py is a basic NN used to classify numbers from the MNIST dataset.
